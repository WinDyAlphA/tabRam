# tabRam
Save up time and ram by exiting all your tabs EXCEPT the ones you choose


You open one million tabs and never close it? This extension is made for you, instead of spamming ctrl+w to close all tabs and risk to close the ONE that you want to keep open. With my extension just select the one that you want to keep and close all others
